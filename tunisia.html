          <div class="row tunisia-map">
            <div class="col">
              <p>It may be but a slim wedge of North Africa’s vast horizontal expanse, but Tunisia has enough history and diverse natural beauty to pack a country many times its size. With a balmy, sand-fringed Mediterranean coast, scented with jasmine and sea breezes, and where the fish on your plate is always fresh, Tunisia is prime territory for a straightforward sun-sand-and-sea holiday. But beyond the beaches, it’s a thrilling, underrated destination where distinct cultures and incredible extremes of landscape – forested coastlines, Saharan sand seas in the south – can be explored in just a few days.</p>

            <h2>TABARKA</h2>
            <p>Visitors choose Tabarka for its exceptional location, between the sea and the mountains. The beaches of golden sand are framed by rocky spurs and forests of pine and cork oak. The crystalline waters hide the precious red coral in its depths. The characteristic silhouette of the Genoese Fort, perched upon an islet, is the emblem of Tabarka. The mountainous backcountry holds the promise of fantastic excursions and hiking around the village of Ain Draham, the entry point to a vast forested mountain range.</p>

            <h2>NABEUL AND CAP BON</h2>
            <p>A promontory pointed towards Sicily, the Cap Bon region is a vast garden where orange and lemon trees put out their flowers in the middle of winter. Its beaches of fine sand are among the most beautiful in Tunisia. The principal town of Cap Bon, Nabeul is famous for its pottery, its rush mats and its flower essences. The fishing port of Kelibia, the thermal springs of Korbous, the falconers of El Haouaria are just a few of the curiosities found in the region.</p>

            <h2>TUNIS</h2>
            <p>A modern metropolis in full growth and major historic city, Tunis is always full of surprises. On the side of the medina, numerous ancient buildings open their doors, some transformed into museums or cultural centres, others into restaurants and tea rooms. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, the medina conceals treasures. From its gates extend picturesque quarters with beautiful façades from the 1900s, whilst on the peripheries, chic restaurants and entertainment venues rub shoulders in the modern quarters.</p>

            <h2>EL KEF</h2>
            <p>Leave behind Tunis and the beaches of the coast and discover a little known side of Tunisia: the Atlas Mountains and the plains of the “hauts plateaux”. In these contrasting landscapes of the west of Tunisia you’ll find Le Kef, a charming little town with a tumultuous past. Natural beauty is not the only thing this region has to offer: the town has held on to countless memories of its vibrant history, including its Ottoman fortress.</p>

            <h2>SOUSSE AND PORT EL KANTAOUI</h2>
            <p>Long beaches, old stones, high palm trees… Sousse is a city ripe with seductions where entertainment and exoticism coexist harmoniously. As a major modern city, it’s one of Tunisia’s most lively coastal resorts. As a historic city, it has conserved a magnificent medina and exceptional monuments from the Middle Ages. Just a few minutes away, a tourist town with Andalusian charm has been built especially for holiday-goers, around a marina: the integrated resort of Port El Kantaoui.</p>

            <h2>TOZEUR AND NEFTA</h2>
            <p>Towns arising from the desert and pressed against vast palm groves, Tozeur and Nefta surprise, fascinate and immerse visitors in a surreal landscape. The burning light of the Sahara pours into narrow streets of the old quarters, between the high façades and golden coloured bricks. In Tozeur, palaces, theme parks and museums have flourished around the old town. In Nefta, countless domes indicate the tombs of saints, overlooking the oasis which nestles in a basin called the Basket. The dunes of the Sahara are just a few kilometres away…</p>

          <div class="col">
            <h2>DOUZ</h2>
            <p>Covered by a fine white mantle reminiscent of a snow-covered landscape, the Douz region offers one of the gentlest ways to approach the desert. Cordons of dunes and graceful bouquets of palm trees fringe the roads the sand slowly reclaims. The golden vastness of the desert is here, at hand, while the palm groves offer delectable shady places to stop in the forests of date palms. In the heart of the region, a vast salty expanse with shimmering reflections: the Chott El-Jerid.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <h2>GABES AND MATMATA</h2>
            <p>Gabes is the only coastal oasis in the Mediterranean, surrounded by fine sand beaches. Its vast palm grove is truly enchanting, and its old city is distinguished by its authentic atmosphere. But Gabes is above all the entrance to the Sahara; the start of a journey between ridges and arid hills, Bedouin tents and old Berber villages. Here you’ll find still-living traditions and an ancestral way of life, such as the stunning underground village of mount Matmata.</p>
